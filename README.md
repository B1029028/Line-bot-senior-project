# Line-bot-senior-project
This is my senior project.
I hope to use artificial intelligence language models (such as ChatGPT) to build a system that can report events and problems in real time. The system will automatically classify reported problems and analyze the effective information in the messages. If it is judged that important relevant information is lacking, The person who made the report will be questioned.
